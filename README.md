See codebook.md for description of dataset, files, variables, etc..

The script is written to align with the 5 steps of the assignment.

   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
   5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each     activity and each subject.
   
The script (run_analysis.R) is commented to provide details in how the data was processed each step of the way.
